FPGA_REGADDR=0 allows CPU to write to an internal register (8 bit) that is the address
    of the internal register to read when FPGA_REGADDR=1. This allows a single bit to be used instead
    of 8 bits for address info on a read/write. REGADDR will increment on each read/write so
    successive reads/writes will write to the next register address, and REGADDR will not need to be
    updated.

FPGA_RW - read or write to data bus
FPGA internal registers
    command: offset 0 (len 4, only LSB = command, others reserved (0), could be used to identify motherboard
       memory, or vram memory, etc.  Different busses.
    data: offset 4 len 4 (to support 32 bit processors)
    addr: offset 8 len 4 (to support 32 bit addressing)
    mode: offset 12 len 4 (perhaps video mode, CPU type, etc)
